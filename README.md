# customer-churn-prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will leave (churn) or stay with a bank.  
We use various classification models and ensemble them to get better performance.

## How to Run
1. Open the `customer_churn_prediction.ipynb` notebook.
2. Run all cells to train the model and save it.

## Dataset
- Dataset used: **Churn_Modelling.csv**
- Features include: Credit Score, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, etc.
- Target variable: `Exited` (1 = customer left, 0 = customer stayed)

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

## Requirements
- pandas
- scikit-learn
